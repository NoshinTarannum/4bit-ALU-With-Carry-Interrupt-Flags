# 4bit-ALU-With-Sign-Zero-Carry-Flags-VHDL

## About

A 4 bit ALU capable of performing addition, subtraction, increment, decrement, AND, NAND, OR, NOR, NOT, XOR, XNOR, ADC (Add with Carry) and SBB (Subtract with Borrow) operations. The ALU also has 3 flags - sign, zero and carry. These flags are used in different control flow instructions in processors.

All the programs and simulations have been run on ***Xilinx ISE Design Suite***.
